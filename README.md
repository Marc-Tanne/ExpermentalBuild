The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

You may serve it with a static server once you have your build folder:

###  yarn global add serve
###  serve -s build

### Note
The optional table objective was only partially completed due to time constraints. In its place, a table which sorts inventory by sell and buy dates in ascending or descending order has been built. In addition, there was not time to execute on a unit test build. If the reviewers would like to see either functionality completed for further assessment, please write back and it will be done.
